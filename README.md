# My Family

Project Description:
My Family is an Android application developed using Android Studio, incorporating advanced technologies to ensure family safety and security. The app leverages the Maps API and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for real-time location fetching, Firebase-Firestore for data storage, and Firebase for protective authentication using Google Sign-In. With a focus on efficient performance, the app utilizes RoomDB and coroutines to handle contact management and background tasks, respectively.



By leveraging advanced technologies such as Maps API, GCP, Firebase Firestore, Google Sign-In, RoomDB, and coroutines, My Family sets a high standard for technical excellence in family safety applications. The app's robust architecture and efficient implementation deliver real-time location sharing, secure authentication, and reliable data management. Experience the power of cutting-edge technology and seamless functionality with My Family, providing unparalleled safety and security for your loved ones.


## Features

Key Technical Features:

Maps API and GCP Integration: My Family integrates with the Maps API and utilizes GCP to fetch the user's current location. This integration provides accurate and up-to-date location data, enhancing the precision and reliability of the app.

Firebase Firestore for Data Storage: The app seamlessly integrates with Firebase Firestore, a cloud-based NoSQL database service. This integration enables efficient storage and retrieval of location data, ensuring seamless synchronization across multiple devices.

Google Sign-In for Protective Authentication: My Family implements Google Sign-In using Firebase authentication services. This protective authentication mechanism ensures secure access to the app, allowing only authorized family members to view and share location information.

Real-Time Location Sharing: My Family facilitates real-time location sharing among family members. By leveraging the Maps API and Firebase Firestore, the app enables seamless transmission and display of location updates, ensuring instant awareness of each family member's whereabouts.

RoomDB for Contact Management: The app utilizes RoomDB, an Android persistence library, to manage the importing and storage of contacts. RoomDB provides efficient handling of contact data, allowing users to easily invite and manage family members within the app.

Thread-Safe Architecture with Coroutines: My Family incorporates coroutines, a concurrency design pattern in Kotlin, to ensure thread safety and responsive user experience. The app offloads heavier tasks, such as data fetching and processing, to background IO threads using coroutines, preventing UI thread blocking and enhancing overall app performance.
